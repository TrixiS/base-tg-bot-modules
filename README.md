Modules for https://github.com/TrixiS/base-tg-bot

Modules provide useful functionality that I often copy-paste between projects. Every directory in the root of this repo is a module. Use can install it into base-tg-bot project via `python3 cli.py module_name_here`.

The code in some files may contain syntax indentation errors - this is done by design, to easily integrate with existing changes in template files of base-tg-bot.
